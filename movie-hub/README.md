On the List page, display upcoming movies, in movie cards, sorted by latest first.
Each movie card should display (in one line, use ellipsis at end)
a. Movie media (picture)
b. Movie Title
c. Rating (average vote)
d. Description
2. The List page should allow for infinite scrolling. You may provide buttons for
paging if you find that convenient (these are not in the mockup).
3. Allow searching for movies using the search API. Search results should be
displayed on the List page itself. When search is cancelled, it should revert to
showing all movies again as in #1 above.
4. When you click on a movie card, the app should navigate to the Details page
showing movie details. Browser back button, or the home button on the Details
page should navigate the user back to the List page. Details page should
display
a. Movie Title
b. Rating (average vote)
c. Year of release
d. Length (HH:MM)
e. Director
f. Cast (Comma separated list of actors)
g. Description
5. Page design should be responsive with a minimum width of 512 pixels.















# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
